# momontumKR
---------

A clone of the productivity chrome app Momentum on Vanilla JS   
And it is KR(korean)ver.

　　　　it was clone coding course of https://nomadcoders.co/ 

### I will add...
- change greetings message(depending on whether the todo-list have the `<li></li>` or not) 
         
　　　　if there's nothing in todo-list, greetings message become "안녕하세요 ${name}님"
- when todo-list have more than 10 list then next `<li></li>` be added by side.
